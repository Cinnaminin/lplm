## LAN PLAYER LIMIT MODIFIER
Also known as LPLM, this mod allows you to change Minecraft's built-in LAN player limit of 8. This includes but is not limited to the Essentials Mod which when hosting, also uses this built-in limit. This Mod also has ModMenu support (OPTIONAL) to configure the player limit. No other players _need_ this installed, only the host does.
